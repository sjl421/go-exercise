Exercise 2: Eating Tapas

Four friends are having dinner together. They ordered five dishes to share, each of which consists of between 5 and 10 morsels.

They eat leisurely, spending between 30 seconds and 3 minutes eating each morsel.

Write a program to simulate the meal.

Running the program might look something like this:

Bon appétit!

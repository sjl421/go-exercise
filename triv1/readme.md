Exercise 1: The Daily Walk

Every morning, Alice and Bob go for a walk, and being creatures of habit, they follow the same routine every day.

First, they both prepare, grabbing sunglasses, perhaps a belt, closing open windows, turning off ceiling fans, and pocketing their phones and keys.

Once they’re both ready, which typically takes each of them between 60 and 90 seconds, they arm the alarm, which has a 60 second delay.

While the alarm is counting down, they both put on their shoes, a process which tends to take each of them between 35 and 45 seconds.

Then they leave the house together and lock the door, before the alarm has finished its countdown.

Write a program to simulate Alice and Bob’s morning routine.

Here’s some sample output from running a solution to this problem.

Let's go for a walk!
